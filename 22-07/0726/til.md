### 22.07.26 What I learned
- Mostly review how to make better functions
- Also done making some LeetCode problems
- But fail to finish some problems

#### Special points
- .find() methods returns the object's index number so we can also use it for the slicing strings.
- That can be really useful for crawling or searching words in lines
- We need to learn more about the math for easily find out better algorithm
- Try to use less loop function
